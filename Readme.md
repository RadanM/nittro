Nittro
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nittro/nittro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nittro/nittro)

Nittro is a javascript client-side framework and library specifically designed to be used with the [Nette framework](https://nette.org).

#### Nittro renamed!
Nittro used to be briefly known as NetteJS, but NetteJS is no more. It's only Nittro now.

The documentation is [right this way](https://github.com/nittro/nittro/wiki).

**Beware**, Nittro isn't yet 100% production ready. Only a part of the codebase is covered by tests
and **there may be bugs**. It's also part of the reason we're not sticking to Semver for now: any commit
can break things, any commit can fix bugs that your code relied on. So if you use Nittro at this point at all,
be sure to be vary of upgrades. Once we reach at least some semblance of a 100% coverage and finalise the API,
version 2.0 will be released and from then on it's Semver as usual.
