Nittro
======

Nittro is a javascript client-side framework and library specifically designed to be used with the [Nette framework](https://nette.org).
It makes your page fully AJAX-driven, taking care of basic things such as applying snippets to the page, updating the
browser history, displaying transition animations while content is being loaded, client-side form validation, AJAX
uploads, flash messages and more. The basics are pretty easy to set up and there are no outside dependencies (no jQuery
for example).

The documentation is [right this way](https://github.com/nittro/nittro/wiki).

You can get a pre-built Nittro package from the [website](https://www.nittro.org/download) or using Bower
(`bower install --save nittro-essentials` or `bower install --save nittro-full`) or you can get the source packages
from NPM (`npm install --save nittro` and optionally `nittro-extras`) and build it yourself using 
the [Gulp](https://github.com/nittro/gulp) or [Grunt](https://github.com/nittro/grunt) plugin.
